# Chenetal2023

This repository contains the code necessary to analyze the wind tunnel data in Chen et al 2023. "Astrocyte growth during morphogenesis is driven by the Tre1/S1pr1 phospholipid-binding G protein-coupled receptor". You can import the raw wind tunnel data from "Raw Data" and process with the importer code in "Importer". You can then create the data for the average values and traces using the data in "Analysis".
