This repository contains the code necessary to analyze the wind tunnel data in Chen et al 2023. "Astrocyte growth during morphogenesis is driven by the Tre1/S1pr1 phospholipid-binding G protein-coupled receptor". The data files from the wind tunnels are avilable on request from the corresponding authors.  You can create the data for the average values and traces using the getaverage and gettraces_jK code in "Analysis".
